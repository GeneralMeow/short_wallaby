VALUES ('1984', 'George Orwell', 'images/book-cover-images/1984-1536x2028.jpg', 'View our feature on George Orwells 1984. Written in 1948, 1984 was George Orwell’s chilling prophecy about the future.'),('All The Birds, Singing', 'Evie Wyld', 'images/book-cover-images/allthebirdssinging-1536x2320.jpg', 'Jake Whyte has retreated to a remote farmhouse on a craggy British island, a place of ceaseless rains and battering winds, with only her collie and a flock of sheep as companions.'),('An Object Of Beauty', 'Steve Martin', 'images/book-cover-images/anobjectofbeatury-1536x2273.jpg', 'Lacey Yeager is young, captivating, and ambitious enough to take the NYC art world by storm. Groomed at Sothebys and hungry to keep climbing the social and career ladders put before her, Lacey charms men and women, old and young, rich and even richer with her magnetic charisma and liveliness. Her ascension to the highest tiers of the city parallel the soaring heights--and, at times, the dark lows--of the art world and the country from the late 1990s through today.'),('Area X', 'Jeff VanderMeer', 'images/book-cover-images/areax-1536x2043.jpg', 'Area X-a remote and lush terrain-has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had died of aggressive cancer. This is the twelfth expedition.'),('Bad Teeth', 'Dustin Long', 'images/book-cover-images/Bad-Teeth-Dustin-Long-1536x2302.jpg', 'Four interlocking narratives set in four American cities form a richly comic feast about love, academia, an elusive Tibetan novelist—and SOFA, a protest group so mysterious its very initials are open to interpretation.
Bad Teeth follows a cast of young literary men and women, each in a period of formation, in four very American cities—Brooklyn, Bloomington, Berkeley, and Bakersfield. A Pynchonesque treat, it’s four or more books in one: a bohemian satire, a campus comedy, a stoner’s reverie, and a quadruple love story. The plots coalesce around the search for a mysterious author, Jigme Drolma the Tibetan David Foster Wallace, who might in fact be a plagiarist. But how does the self-styled arch-magician Nicholas Bendix figure into this? What will happen when SOFA unleashes the Apocalypse? And whats to become of Lump, the cat?'),('The Book Of Dead Philosophers', 'Simon Critchley', 'images/book-cover-images/book-of-dead-philosophers-1536x2760.png', 'In this collection of brief lives (and deaths) of nearly two hundred of the worlds greatest thinkers, noted philosopher Simon Critchley creates a register of mortality that is tragic, amusing, absurd, and exemplary. From the self-mocking haikus of Zen masters on their deathbeds to the last words of Christian saints and modern-day sages, this irresistible book contains much to inspire both amusement and reflection. Informed by Critchleys acute insight, scholarly intelligence, and sprightly wit, each entry tells its own tale, but collected together they add up to a profound and moving investigation of meaning and the possibility of happiness for us all.'),('Breathing Room', 'Peter Davison', 'images/book-cover-images/breathingroom-1536x2233.jpg', 'The poems in Peter Davisons exuberant new collection contemplate the paradox of growing old--of having a mind still a juicy swamp of invention in a body beginning to falter. Both intimate and generous, these poems celebrate the cycle of the seasons, of death and rebirth: snapping turtles lay their eggs and new ones hatch;  a ruffed grouse drums his spring mating dance. Memory is central: a mothers lost face; a fathers voice that plumbed the marrow of poetry as tenderly as if a darling had crept into his arms; a wifes rueful eyes, cornflower blue. And the poet pays tribute to the literary life--to reading, to the precise moment a word rises to consciousness, to getting over Robert Frost, to the mind of Sylvia Plath. These are poems that expand time for us and deepen place, whether Davison is taking us on a path along a limestone cliff under canopies of holly and ivy, or is revisiting the instant while recovering from surgery when it becomes clear he is going to heal. Breathing Room gives us a splendid array of poems that we want to read with all our senses'),('Burn This Book', 'Toni Morrison (ed.)', 'images/book-cover-images/burn-this-book-1536x2306.jpg', 'As Americans we often take our freedom of speech for granted. When we talk about censorship we talk about China, the former Soviet Union, or the Middle East. But recent political developments—including the passage of the Patriot Act—have shined a spotlight on profound acts of censorship in our own backyard. Burn This Book features a sterling roster of award-winning writers offering their incisive, uncensored views on this most essential topic, including such revered literary heavyweights as Toni Morrison, Salman Rushdie, Orhan Pamuk, David Grossman, and Nadine Gordimer, among others. Both provocative and timely, Burn This Book is certain to inspire strong opinions and ignite spirited, serious dialogue.'),( 'Columbine', 'Dave Cullen', 'images/book-cover-images/columbine-1536x2370.jpg', 'The tragedies keep coming. As we reel from the latest horror. So begins a new epilogue, illustrating how Columbine became the template for nearly two decades of spectacle murders. It is a false script, seized upon by a generation of new killers. In the wake of Newtown, Aurora, and Virginia Tech, the imperative to understand the crime that sparked this plague grows more urgent every year. What really happened April 20, 1999? The horror left an indelible stamp on the American psyche, but most of what we know is wrong. It wasnt about jocks, Goths, or the Trench Coat Mafia. Dave Cullen was one of the first reporters on scene, and spent ten years on this book-widely recognized as the definitive account. With a keen investigative eye and psychological acumen, he draws on mountains of evidence, insight from the worlds leading forensic psychologists, and the killers own words and drawings-several reproduced in a new appendix. Cullen paints raw portraits of two polar opposite killers. They contrast starkly with the flashes of resilience and redemption among the survivors.'),('The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-time', 'Mark Hadden','images/book-cover-images/curious-incident-of-the-dog-1536x2358.png', 'Christopher John Francis Boone knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057. He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. Although gifted with a superbly logical brain, Christopher is autistic. Everyday interactions and admonishments have little meaning for him. Routine, order and predictability shelter him from the messy, wider world. Then, at fifteen, Christophers carefully constructed world falls apart when he finds his neighbors dog, Wellington, impaled on a garden fork, and he is initially blamed for the killing. Christopher decides that he will track down the real killer and turns to his favorite fictional character, the impeccably logical Sherlock Holmes, for inspiration. But the investigation leads him down some unexpected paths and ultimately brings him face to face with the dissolution of his parents marriage. As he tries to deal with the crisis within his own family, we are drawn into the workings of Christophers mind.'),('David Lynch', 'David Lynch', 'images/book-cover-images/davidlynch-1536x1987.jpg','David Lynch erupted onto the cinema landscape in 1977 with Eraserhead, establishing himself as one of the most original and imaginative directors at work in contemporary cinema. Over the course of his career, he has remained true to a vision of the innocent lost in darkness and confusion, balancing hallucination and surrealism with a sense of Americana that is as pure and simple as his compelling storylines. In this volume, Lynch speaks openly about his films as well as about his lifelong commitment to painting, his work in photography, his television projects, and his musical collaborations with Angelo Badalamenti.'),('December', 'Elizabeth Hartley Winthrop', 'images/book-cover-images/december-1536x2203.jpg', 'Centered on a young girl who inexplicably stops speaking, December is a riveting and insightful portrait of a family in crisis. Nine months after eleven-year-old Isabelle suddenly fell silent, her parents, Wilson and Ruth, are at their wits end. And what began as self-protection has spiraled beyond Isabelles control; she has become trapped in her silence, horrified by the pain she is causing and terrified of losing her old self to this cold young girl she barely recognizes. Isabelle must confront her overwhelming anger and love for her family, a cast of charming yet dangerous characters, and her own fears, before finally finding her voice.'),('Dept. Of Speculation', 'Jenny Offill', 'images/book-cover-images/deptofspeculation-1536x2357.jpg', 'In the beginning, it was easy to imagine their future. They were young and giddy, sure of themselves and of their love for each other. Dept. of Speculation was their code name for all the thrilling uncertainties that lay ahead. Then they got married, had a child and navigated the familiar calamities of family life—a colicky baby, a faltering relationship, stalled ambitions. When their marriage reaches a sudden breaking point, the wife tries to retrace the steps that have led them to this place, invoking everything from Kafka to the Stoics to doomed Russian cosmonauts as she analyzes what is lost and what remains. In language that shimmers with rage and longing and wit, Offill has created a brilliantly suspenseful love story—a novel to read in one sitting, even as its piercing meditations linger long after the last page.'),('Devil In The Details: Scenes From An Obsessive Girlhood', 'Jennifer Traig', 'images/book-cover-images/devilinthedetails-1060x1590.jpg', 'Recalling the agony of growing up as an obsessive-compulsive religious fanatic, Traig fearlessly confesses the most peculiar behaviour - like scrubbing her hands for a full half-hour before meals, feeding her stuffed animals before herself, and washing everything she owned because she thought it was contaminated by pork fumes!'),('Dracula', 'Bram Stoker', 'images/book-cover-images/draculabramstoker-1536x2369.jpg', 'Long before Dark Shadows or Twilight there was Bram Stokers classic novel about a bloodthirsty vampire and his search for new blood--Dracula is perhaps the most famous vampire story of all time.'),('Dyna-Mite', 'Various Authors', 'images/book-cover-images/dyna_mite.png', 'This book is a book about dynamite!'),('Elsewhere; A Curated Lifestyle','Various','images/book-cover-images/elsewhere.png','July 1940. 11 year-old Lydia walks through a village in rural Suffolk on a baking hot day. She is wearing a gas mask. The shops and houses are empty, windows boarded up and sandbags green with mildew, the village seemingly deserted. Leaving it behind, she strikes off down a country lane through the salt marshes to a large Edwardian house - the house she grew up in. Lydia finds it empty too, the windows covered in black-out blinds. Her family are gone.'),('The End Of Food', 'Paul Roberts', 'images/book-cover-images/endoffood-1536x2311.jpg', 'The end of food is neigh!'),('An Ethics Of Interrogation', 'Michael Skerker', 'images/book-cover-images/ethics-of-interrogation-1536x2291.png', 'The act of interrogation, and the debate over its use, pervades our culture, whether through fictionalized depictions in movies and television or discussions of real-life interrogations on the news. But despite daily mentions of the practice in the media, there is a lack of informed commentary on its moral implications. Moving beyond the narrow focus on torture that has characterized most work on the subject, An Ethics of Interrogation is the first book to fully address this complex issue.'),('Euphoria', 'Lily King', 'images/book-cover-images/euphoria-1536x2304.jpg', 'Euphoria is Lily Kings nationally bestselling breakout novel of three young, gifted anthropologists of the 30s caught in a passionate love triangle that threatens their bonds, their careers, and, ultimately, their lives. Inspired by events in the life of revolutionary anthropologist Margaret Mead, Euphoria is dazzling ... suspenseful ... brilliant...an exhilarating novel.—Boston Globe');
