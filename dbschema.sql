And there is Jake’s relentless past—one she tried to escape thousands of miles away and years ago, concealed in stubborn silence and isolation and the scars that stripe her back.

A Pynchonesque treat, it’s four (or more) books in one: a bohemian satire, a campus comedy, a stoner’s reverie, and a quadruple love story.

Paulo Coelhos masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiagos journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along lifes path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams."),("The Boy Who Couldn't Sleep And Never Had To", "DC Pierson", "images/book-cover-images/theboywhocouldnt-1060x1635.jpg", "When Darren Bennett meets Eric Lederer, theres an instant connection. They share a love of drawing, the bottom rung on the cruel high school social ladder and a pathological fear of girls.  Then Eric reveals a secret: He doesnt sleep. Ever.  When word leaks out about Erics condition, he and Darren find themselves on the run. Is it the government trying to tap into Erics mind, or something far darker?  It could be that not sleeping is only part of what Erics capable of, and the truth is both better and worse than they could ever imagine"),("The Brief History Of The Dead", "Kevin Brockmeier", "images/book-cover-images/thebriefhistoryofthedead.jpg", "The City is inhabited by those who have departed Earth but are still remembered by the living. They will reside in this afterlife until they are completely forgotten. But the City is shrinking, and the residents clearing out. Some of the holdouts, like Luka Sims, who produces the Citys only newspaper, are wondering what exactly is going on. Others, like Coleman Kinzler, believe it is the beginning of the end. Meanwhile, Laura Byrd is trapped in an Antarctic research station, her supplies are running low, her radio finds only static, and the power is failing. With little choice, Laura sets out across the ice to look for help, but time is running out. Kevin Brockmeier alternates these two storylines to create a lyrical and haunting story about love, loss and the power of memory."),
